                            Once you apply for IEC registration, no return filings are required. Once you get your
                            registration done, there isn’t any prerequisite to follow any kind of procedure for
                            supporting its legitimacy. There isn’t any prerequisite for documenting any profits with
                            DGFT also. Hence, there is no filling of returns.

                            It is genuinely very simple to acquire IEC code from the DGFT within a period of 10 to 15
                            days subsequent after applying. There isn’t any need to give a proof of any fare or import
                            for getting IEC code.

                            IEC code is viable for the lifetime of an element and requires no reestablishment. After it
                            is acquired, it could be utilized by a substance against all fare and import exchanges.
